//! Enumeration of RS2 sensor options.
//!
//! Not all options apply to every sensor. In order to retrieve the correct options,
//! one must iterate over the `sensor` object for option compatibility.
//!
//! Notice that this option refers to the `sensor`, not the device. However, the device
//! used also matters; sensors that are alike across devices are not guaranteed to share
//! the same sensor options. Again, it is up to the user to query whether an option
//! is supported by the sensor before attempting to set it. Failure to do so may cause
//! an error in operation.
