[features]
# default
# - The default build. This uses RealSense v0.39 bindings, generated by bindgen
#   and imported into src/ via realsense-sys/bindings.
default = []
# buildtime-bindgen
# - This activates bindgen during build time to rebuild the generated intel
#   bindings based off of the RealSense version that you are using. Running this
#   feature is recommended if you're not on the latest version of the RealSense
#   driver.
