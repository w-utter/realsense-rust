# realsense-sys

Generate and use RealSense C library bindings as a Rust crate. This crate is used as a base layer in the more
user-friendly [realsense-rust](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision-oss/realsense-rust) crate; we recommend use of
realsense-rust if possible in order to better maintain Rust memory safety.

Compatible with RealSense SDK v2.0 and up.

**Default bindings are for librealsense version: 2.50.0**

## Usage

This crate finds and links the RealSense SDK. Though one can use the generated bindings directly, this crate is meant as
a base layer for [realsense-rust](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision-oss/realsense-rust).

To use this crate, add this line in your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
realsense-sys = "<current version number>"
```

## Regenerating the API Bindings

Bindgen relies on clang to generate new FFI bindings. See the OS Use Notes below for more.

_Non-Linux users_: The current bindings are formatted for Linux. Users on systems other than Linux must run with the
`buildtime-bindgen` feature to reformat the bindings. See more notes for your platform below.

_Backwards compatibility_: If you're using an older librealsense version, you may enable the `buildtime-bindgen` feature
to re-generate the bindings. We make no claims of backwards compatibility; good luck.

With all of that said: Run the following to regenerate the realsense2 SDK bindings:

`cargo build --features buildtime-bindgen`

# OS Use Notes

## Linux

You can install Clang using the following command:

`sudo apt install libclang-dev clang`

If the realsense2 SDK is installed, pkg-config will detect the [realsense2.pc](./realsense2.pc) config file automatically. This will load
the necessary headers and libraries.

## Windows

**NOTE**: The current bindings are formatted for Linux. Users must run with the `buildtime-bindgen` feature active to
reformat the bindings for Windows platforms.

This installation process assumes that the RealSense SDK was installed through the .exe wizard downloadable from [the
librealsense asset page](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.47.0). This process will install
the SDK in `C:/Program Files (x86)/Intel RealSense SDK 2.0`. If your installation is in another place, modify the
`prefix` line in [realsense2.pc](./realsense2.pc) to the right path.

### Install Pkg-config and Clang

Install pkg-config via Chocolatey:

1. https://chocolatey.org/install (if not already on the system)
2. `choco install pkgconfiglite`
3. `choco install llvm` for bindgen (if not already installed)

### Guide Pkg-config to realsense2.pc

Set the pkg-config path in Powershell to the realsense-sys directory. One can do this in two ways:

**First Option: Modify pkg-config's environment variables**

To do this, run

`$Env:PKG_CONFIG_PATH="C:\Users\< path_to_repo >\realsense-rust\realsense-sys\"`

This will help pkg-config find the [realsense2.pc](./realsense2.pc) file located in this directory. This file tells pkg-config where to
locate the headers and libraries necessary for RealSense operation. The Windows wizard does not provide this file, so we
provide it ourselves.

It's a good idea to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` Environment Variable globally as well via the System Properties. _BUT
NOTE_: Environment Variables set through the Windows System Properties will not apply until the host machine is power
cycled. Yep. That's a thing.

**Second Option: Add [realsense2.pc](./realsense2.pc) to pkg-config's search directory**

Run the following command...

`pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config`

...to identify the directory (or directories) that pkg-config uses to find \*.pc files. Copy [realsense2.pc](./realsense2.pc) to that
directory. Boom, done.
