[features]
# - The default build. This uses RealSense bindings, generated by bindgen and imported into src/ via
#   realsense-sys/bindings.

# - Rebuild the FFI bindings used to interface with the RealSense API. This flag is passed to the realsense-sys
#   Cargo.toml.

# - This feature does nothing in terms of library functionality / behaviour, but is instead for running tests that
#   utilize a single device on the backend.
